Resources for the event and workshop:
- Liberating H5P page (interactive book)
- ZIP file of images to use for workshop participants
- h5p project file

**Please note**
A recent change to the online version of the Lumi App breaks the instructions contained in this tutorial. To mitigate, we recommend (as in the tutorial) that you download the desktop version of the Lumi editor app, which does not appear to be affected by the changes (yet?). I reached out to the dev for comment but have not had any replies.
